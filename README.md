# langou
Langou is an app built with Python to help overcome the inequality of language barriers through real-time support and natural language processing analytics to improve the user's comprehension and vocabulary of the language. We support Spanish, French, and English languages as of now and hope to expand this in the coming future. The app works by a user selecting a language preference from the home screen and entering a body of text, whether that
be an essay or an email that they are working on. Langou provides writing suggestions in different languages as well as helps the user visualize their vocabulary through a word cloud. The word replacement suggestions are not simply synonyms, but words that truly fit in the context of what
the user is writing. We accomplish this through a word embeddings model trained on a novel text corpus from domain articles online. This implements unsupervised machine learning algorithms to transform words to vector embeddings in an
embedding space and capture semantic similarities in context.
